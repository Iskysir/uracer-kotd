GAMEPLAY, RENDERING and CONSIDERATIONS

	- version information should be stored differently, git-log output shouldn't expose so much androidmanifest/etc..

	x LapInfo should be accessed as DriftInfo, single-lived components are better accessible than instance-owned one in this
	  design approach
	  
		- extrapolate the pattern and identify abstractable areas, create a SharedComponent interface with a more meaningful name

	- smoke due to skid marks, a simple and efficient implemention will do it
	- better total drift score's and real-time score's placement, dynamics, logic separation and appearance
	- improve drift detection, provide a simple way to manage different detection policies
	- improve the way missed drifts and associated drift points are exposed to the player *WHILE* playing and producing this event
	- determine optimal texture size for cars, fake ambient occlusion, skid marks and such
	  
AUDIO

	- car engine
		- pitch twiddling on the audio stream
		- latency?
		
	- while producing skid marks
		- latency?
		
	- on collision
		- LATENCY?
		
	- sound track
 		- (i don't give a shit about latency in this case)
